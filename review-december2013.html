        <p>
        Holiday season and myths-- Santa just is a white man, Cyber Monday is a de-facto holiday, so put them together and you have a future where Amazon drones... We are thoroughly within it. Rather than just settle in and get cozy with our <a href="http://122909a.com/">post-internet</a> overlords, 

        What is an internet? as a two-part question-- 1) Physically, what is it made out of and 2) Psychologically, how do we conceive of and utilize it. When it was new, we used to think of it as a place to create new identities, a place to pretend 

		<h2 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: #5B6853; font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Nevis', 'Ubuntu', sans-serif;">SLOW INTERNET PROJECT OF THE MONTH</h2>


		Not that in Ghana, the Internet is for scams-- <a href="http://www.cybercrimejournal.com/warner2011ijcc.pdf">a report on Ghanian cyber-crime</a> reminds readers that "the leading state involved in cybercrime is the United States, followed by the U.K." Sakawa- "an ever-evolving klepto-theological paradigm created to abet in the perpetration of Internet crime." (Warner 2011: 744)

		"If [cybercrime] was just a technical issue, we would have made more headway. But now that there is a ritual and religious aspect to it, that makes it much harder to stop." (Warner 2011: 745)

		

        "Many rumours also depict young men shape-shifting into snakes which then vomit money, an image which has also been linked to traditional Ewe symbols of often diabolical fertility." 

        "Many ethnographies have descrived witches' abilities to travel large distances in mysteriously little time. Rosalind Shaw's Sierra Leonean ethnography recounts rumours of witches flying to London and back within an hour (Shaw 1997: 857). Similarly, the internet allows Sakawa boys to manipulate its compression of time and space, transcending national boundaries and engaging in worldwide spiritual travel. Shaw also describes how the Temne of Sierra Leone believe in an invisible, global space full of illicit wealth known as the 'Place of Witches'"

        "Sakawa boy's power as described by Akosua and many others is a particular form of occult agency which is distributed via the internet. Anthropologists have commented on the often 'dividual' nature of witchcraft personhood with witches having the power to be in multiple places at once; dispersing their agency via bodily transcendence whilst appearing physically present (Geschiere 1997;:127; Strathern 1988; Shaw 1997). Similarly, Sakawa boys are rumoured to appear as normal, sat in front of a monitor whilst their spirit possesses multiple foreign fraud targets. Sakawa movies such as 'Sakawa Boys 2: Mallam Issa Kawa' (Dir. Socrate Safo 2009) often conclude with the demise of the Sakawa boy by his seeming physical presence yet spiritual death."

        All of this is to say: we always understand our present world in the terms of what we are culturally most familiar with. A combination of tradition and geopolitics. Sakawa boys as young unemployed men making a buck through dubious means at the expense of foreigners in a culture that places unfamiliar objets and processes within a multifacited realm called "witchcraft."

        Series of tubes (when we get confused). Reality-distortion field. Magic, (Arthur Clarke's "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"). The whole history of cyberpunk, science fiction. Sakawa is a reminder that the dominant West Coast, English-speaking, VC-funded parables about the Internet-- what it does for us, what it was built for, its canonized past and inevitablized future-- is one narrative out of a potential many. This is not a "bad" source of metaphors and parables to pick from, but it is necessarily limited. It is always shape shifting, and those writing the stories do a good job of helping us forget what the old tales were-- in the late 80's, the Internet was a place for scientists to share data. By the mid-90's, it was a site for social experimentation and identity. More recently, it's a place where identity has been monitized, and so we have to use our real names or at least consistent cookies across sites.

        What is the internet <i>for</i>? Well, to some it is a technology that will enable http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/05/on-google-island/ Google Island, a http://inthesetimes.com/article/3328/floating_utopias/ Libertarian fantasy.

        It would be a mistake to think of the Internet as narrated by Peter Thiel, Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, et al as the neutral, standard, <a href="https://abagond.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/the-white-default">default</a> Internet.



		<p  style="font-style: italic;">Forgot about us, didn't you? Well, that's alright. We don't blame you. With Fast Internet, another fascinating story is just a link away. It's easy to get distracted. So here's a recap:</p>
		<p>
			Fast Internet this week is consumed with the news of the Twitter IPO. The noble innovators of the world's hottest microadvertising platform join the Wall Street fraternity and emerge as newly minted billionaires. Meanwhile, a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html">snarky smile</a> greets your data at the edge of the Google Cloud where the NSA injects its all seeing eye. The Internet, it would seem, is run by growth-hungry corporations intent on moving your data deeper into walled gardens of questionable security. Sounds like a nice place to <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/6-ghost-town/">hang out</a>, right?
		</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html"><img src="http://slowerinternet.com/review/november2013/GOOGLE-CLOUD-EXPLOITATION1383148810.png" width="538" height="404" style="border: 0" alt="SSL added and removed here"/></a></p>

		<h2 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: #5B6853; font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Nevis', 'Ubuntu', sans-serif;">SLOW INTERNET PROJECT OF THE MONTH</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="http://sqlite.org"><img src="http://slowerinternet.com/review/november2013/sqlite.gif" width="220" height="101" style="float: right; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; border: 0px" alt="SQLite logo"/></a>
			For this month's feature project, we'll take a look at a company that hasn't made news in years, if ever, but is most central to your experience of the web. Use services provided by <a href="https://sqlite.org/famous.html">Adobe, Apple, Dropbox, Firefox, Google, Intuit, McAfee, Microsoft, PHP, Python, or Skype</a>? Then, likely without your knowledge, you have used <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, a minimalist database system developed by <a href="http://hwaci.com/">Hipp, Wyrick & Company, Inc.</a> ("Hwaci" [not to be confused with former BattleBots heavyweight champion <a href="http://www.teamwhyachi.com/">Team Whyachi</a>]).
		</p>

		
		<p>
			The Internet is built with a multitude of technologies developed under a variety of social arrangements. The most well known "alternative" development approach is probably <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free/Libre/Open Source software</a>, exemplified by the GNU/Linux operating system- a popular choice for web servers around the globe. So what makes Hwaci and SQLite particularly notable? Not only is SQLite the <a href="https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most widely deployed</a> database in existence (part of nearly every smartphone and web browser out there), it is released under a license of utmost selflessness: SQLite is, always has been, and always will be available in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Download the <a href="https://sqlite.org/2013/sqlite-amalgamation-3080100.zip">SQLite source code</a> and examine the comment on lines 29-37: 
		</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://slowerinternet.com/review/november2013/sqlite-source.png" width="680" height="726" alt="May you do good and not evil." title="May you do good and not evil. May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others. May you share freely, never taking more than you give." /></p>
		
		<p>
			(Lest you think that koan-peddling Steve Jobs delivered us the deepest insights into Zen and the art of computing, remember that the Buddha never quipped to the facile tune of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmPq00jelpc">"it just works."</a> These lines of SQLite source, however, read as if a <a href="http://dharma.ncf.ca/introduction/sutras/metta-sutra.html">Metta Sutta</a> directly from the Enlightened One's mouth.)
		</p>

		<p>
			Various free culture licenses have been depicted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjaC8Pq9-V0">revolutionary</a> terms, but it is important to remember that they all rely on the same legal and philosophical foundations which enable even the most oppressive abuses of copyright law. In order to dictate how a certain artifact may be used, to "license" its use even in the most "free" or "open" terms, one must assert total and complete ownership over the work. But to declare a work to be in the public domain is to nullify its status as property; to make something un-ownable is perhaps the most radical act in the face of hegemonic computational neoliberalism.
		</p>

		<p>
			The paradox then of this copyright disclaimer is that it does not relegate SQLite to the realm of hobby project for a handful of benevolent developers in a gift-based economy. Instead, it is the lifeblood for a <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/staff.html">husband-and-wife team</a> in North Carolina (and a <a href="https://sqlite.org/crew.html">couple of other developers around the world</a>) that earn income by providing <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/prosupport.html">support</a> for their anti-property. They have forgone capital for a life of <a href="http://www.labour-in-a-single-shot.net/en/films/">labor</a>.

		<p>
			It is something of a tradition in Silicon Valley culture that such noble Davids not only slay, but ultimately become Goliaths themselves. Nerdy computer scientists begin as underdogs and end up <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/opinion/sunday/the-banality-of-googles-dont-be-evil.html">rewriting geopolitical policy</a>. But there will never be a <a href="http://designgeopolitics.org/blog/2010/11/on-geoscapes-and-the-google-caliphate-reflections-on-the-mumbai-attacks/">SQLite caliphate</a> or Hwaci IPO:
		</p>

		<blockquote style="line-height: 1.5em;	font-style: italic;">
			"Hwaci is a small company but it is also closely held and debt-free and has low fixed costs, which means that it is largely immune to buy-outs and take-overs and market down-turns. Hwaci intends to continue operating in its current form, and at roughly its current size, for decades to come. We expect to be here when you need us, even if that need is many years in the future."
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			A Slower Internet requires attention to <a href="http://slowerinternet.com/principles.html">more than speed</a>, and likewise, doesn't prescribe fundamental limits on <i>size</i>, but a rough correlation can be drawn between modest size and respect for user autonomy. Hwaci is driven by a set of values separate from those of the hype-machine that brought us "the cloud," a concept which upon reification normalized the most massive spying apparatus known in human history. Hwaci will always favor remaining small and SQLite will always favor the paradigm of the <i>local</i>. The philosophy alluded to by the comments is manifest in the code: SQLite treats databases not as servers woven together by a murky TCP/IP abstraction, but as files that exist in the relatively non-virtual space of a single hard drive or memory chip. It is a platform made for modesty, more tuned to the dynamics of a community garden than a Monsanto-like conglomerate.

			The first snowfall of the year has graced the plains outside the Consortium's Minneapolis, Minnesota headquarters. The lakes will freeze over soon, and that means it's almost ice fishing season. Once content to simply teasing the creatures below with a taste of fresh food, humans on the sunny side of the ice now drop electronic eyes alongside their hooks to capture, track, and transmit the activities of unwitting brown fish to a global audience. Before you rush back to all that Fast Internet has to offer, we suggest you take a few minutes to enjoy the walley, northern pike, and muskies in this <a href="https://vimeo.com/3169554">short film from an icy Lake Mille Lacs</a>.
